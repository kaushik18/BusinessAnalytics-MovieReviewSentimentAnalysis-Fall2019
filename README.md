For Business Analytics final project, we built a sentiment analysis based analysis on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews:

Our problem statement is :: How do different machine learning models perform in classifying a sentiment 
accurately based on text analysis and in extension, what visualizations can be developed to better understand the data?

Group roles :: 
  
  Kaushik Nadimpalli - Some Preprocessing, Some Algorithm Design, and Model Building 
  Kishn Patel - Data Preparation, Elementary EDA, Some Preprocessing
  Omar Murad - Some Preprocessing and Visualizations (Bar plot and Pie Chart)
  Bhoomi Naik - Some Algorithm Design and Visualizations (WordClouds and Frequency Distributions)
   
   
Final Conclusions and Recommendations after analysis 
  Overall, our analysis consisted of 2 parts
   1) Building models to predict sentiment and finding out the accuracy of those models
   2) Performing additional EDA and Preprocessing to build visualizations that showcase possible recommendations in order to build better models

   Suggestions - 
    1) Better Algorithms to remove generic high-frequency terminology present in each sentiment
    2) Better development of models (not just using classifiers) with the help of the NLTK library
