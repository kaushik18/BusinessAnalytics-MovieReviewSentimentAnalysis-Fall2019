For Business Analytics final project, we built a sentiment analysis based analysis on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews:

Our problem statement is :: How do different machine learning models perform in classifying a sentiment 
accurately based on text analysis and in extension, what visualizations can be developed to better understand the data?

Group roles
  Kishan Patel
    Data Preparation, Elementary EDA, Some Preprocessing
  Kaushik Nadimpalli
   Some Preprocessing, Some Algorithm Design, and Model Building 
  Omar Murad
   Some Preprocessing and Visualizations (Bar plot and Pie Chart)
  Bhoomi Naik: 
   Some Algorithm Design and Visualizations (WordClouds and Frequency Distributions)
   
   
Final Conclusions and Recommendations after analysis 
  Overall, our analysis consisted of 2 parts
    Building models to predict sentiment and finding out the accuracy of those models
    Performing additional EDA and Preprocessing to build visualizations that showcase possible recommendations in order to build better models

   Suggestions
    Better Algorithms to remove generic high-frequency terminology present in each sentiment
    Better development of models (not just using classifiers) with the help of the NLTK library
